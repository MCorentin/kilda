# KILDA

KILDA (KIv2 Length Determined from a kmer Analysis) provides an alignment-free estimation of the number of KIV2 (Kringle-IV type 2) repeats from FASTQ files.
The KIV2 copy number is estimated from the occurences of kmers specific to the KIV2 sequence, normalised by kmers from one or more normalisation region(s).

## Rationale

The KIV2 copy number is determined by comparing the mean occurence of kmers specific to the KIV2 repeats (in blue in the plot below) against the mean occurence of kmers specific to a normalisation region (e.g. the *LPA* gene, yellow in the plot below):

![kilda_plot](./images/HG00590_cov.png "Plot generated by KILDA. The distribution of the occurences of the KIV2 and LPA kmers are represented in blue and yellow respectively.")

KILDA needs kmers specific to the regions of interest to work. For ease-of-use we are providing pre-computed lists of kmers in this repository, with the *LPA* gene as the normalisation region: see [KIV2 kmers](./data/kmers_GRCh38_LPA_k31/KIV2_hg38_kmers_6copies_specific.tsv) and [LPA kmers](./data/kmers_GRCh38_LPA_k31/KIV2_hg38_kmers_6copies_specific.tsv) in [./data/](./data/).

These lists have been built using [GRCh38](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_47/GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa.gz "GRCh38 primary assembly from GenCode") based on the regions defined in [./data/KIV2_hg38.bed](./data/KIV2_hg38.bed) and [./data/LPA_hg38.bed](./data/LPA_hg38.bed)

If you want to change the normalisation region(s), see [Creating a new kmer DB](#creating-a-new-kmer-db).

## Quick start

The pipeline is centralised around [kilda.nf](./kilda.nf).

First, move to KILDA's installation directory and pull the [Singularity image](https://cloud.sylabs.io/library/mcorentin/kilda/kiv2_20240530):

```shell
cd /path/to/kilda/
singularity pull library://mcorentin/kilda/kiv2_20240530:0.2
```

Then, create an input samplesheet, see [input formats](#input-formats), define the paths to *wdir* (default is the current folder) and *samplesheet* in the config file and launch the pipeline:

```shell
nextflow run /path/to/kilda.nf -c /path/to/kilda.conf
```

Output example:

```
ID      KIV2_CN rs41272114_ref  rs41272114_alt 	quantile
HG00114 32.53   47      		0      			4
HG00111 34.64   46      		0      			6
HG00106 40.68   44      		0      			9
HG00149 38.95   41      		0      			8
HG00112 37.01   44      		0      			7
HG00109 35.12   58      		0      			6
HG00141 29.96   52      		0      			3
HG00233 26.81   27      		22     			1
HG00123 28.53   31      		0      			2
```

*ID*: the sample identifier

*KIV_CN*: the KIV2 copy number detected with KILDA

*rs41272114_ref*: the occurence of kmers representing rs41272114 reference allele

*rs41272114_alt*: the occurence of kmers representing rs41272114 alternative allele

*quantile*: which decile the sample belongs to within this group

## Dependencies

You will need to have [NextFlow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/install.html) and [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html) installed on your system.

**Note: KILDA will not work with NextFlow versions lower than v21.** 

**Note:** The scripts were developed and tested on Linux (Debian release 11) using nextflow 22.04.5 and Python 3.9.2.


We made a Singularity image with the rest of the dependencies. The image can be pulled from [Sylabs](https://cloud.sylabs.io/library/mcorentin/kilda/kiv2_20240530):
```shell
singularity pull library://mcorentin/kilda/kiv2_20240530:0.2
```

Alternatively, you can build the image using the recipe provided in this repository [kiv2_20240530.def](./kiv2_20240530.def):
```shell
sudo singularity build kiv2_20240530_0.2.sif kiv2_20240530.def
```

If you do not wish, or cannot, use the provided Singularity image, you will need to have the following dependencies installed on your system:
- **jellyfish** (tested with v2.2.10)
- **samtools**  (tested with v1.19)
- **bedtools**  (tested with v2.27.1)
- **Python v3 or higher**
- **The following python packages:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib (note: the following packages should be installed by default: getopt, sys, os, warnings)

## Test Dataset

A test dataset is available under [./test_dataset/](./test_dataset), it can be launched with the following commands:

```
cd /path/to/kilda/

singularity pull library://mcorentin/kilda/kiv2_20240530:0.2

cd ./test_dataset/

nextflow-22.04.5-all run ../kilda.nf -c kilda_test.conf
```

The analysis should run in a few minutes, and KILDA output will be available under: *./results/kilda_kiv2_CNs/kilda_kiv2.CNs*

The file should contain the following results (the samples order might be different):
```
ID      KIV2_CN rs41272114_ref  rs41272114_alt  rs10455872_ref  rs10455872_alt  rs3798220_ref   rs3798220_alt   quantile

```

## Launching the pipeline

### The config file

The config file contains the parameters necessary to launch the analysis. You can use the default values for most of them, unless you need to change the normalisation regions or add SNPs to the rsids list.

#### General options

- *wdir*: the directory where the analysis will be run and where the output will be stored.

- *kmer_size*: the kmer length, we recommend a value > 21, larger values are more accurate but need more computational power and are more sensitive to errors in the kmers.

KILDA can take a list of SNPs with representative reference/alternative kmers (see [input formats](#input-formats)), and will return the occurences of each kmer. This can be used to assess the presence/absence of Lp(a)-related SNPs to add context around the KIV2 copy-number.

#### Creating a new kmer DB

The following parameters must be set to create a new kmer database (instead of the one given within this repo [./data/kmers_GRCh38_LPA_k31/](./data/kmers_GRCh38_LPA_k31/).

 - *build_DB*: if "true" a new kmer DB step will be run.

 - *outdir*: directory where the kmer files will be stored (two *.tsv* and two *.fasta* files).

 - *genome_fasta*: path to the reference genome fasta file.

 - *genome_fai*: path to the reference index file (produced with `samtools faidx`)

 - *norm_bed*: path to the bed file defining the normalisation region(s) to use

 - *kiv2_bed*: path to the bed file defining the KIV2 region.

The pipeline will then (i) extract the kmers from the regions defined in the beds, (ii) keep the one with the correct occurences (1 for normalisation and 6 for KIV2), (iii) remove kmers that are occuring elsewhere on the genome, and (iv) remove common kmers between the normalisation region(s) and the KIV2 region.

This will produce two *.tsv* and two *.fasta* files, named as following:
    - For KIV2: <input_bed_name>_kmers_6copies_specific.{tsv, fasta}
    - For the normalisation: <input_bed_name>_kmers_1copies_specific.{tsv, fasta}

The *.tsv* files are the one needed for the KIV2 count step.

#### KIV2 counts

The following parameters must be set to count the number of KIV2 in a cohort.

 - *count_kiv2*: if "true" the KIV2 repeats will be counted

 - *samplesheet*: path to the samplesheet defining the path to the FASTQ files

 - *kiv2_kmers*: path to the *.tsv* file listing the kmers specific to KIV2

 - *norm_kmers*: path to the *.tsv* file listing the kmers specific to the normalisation region(s)

 - *rsids_list*: optional: path to the file listing a list of rsids of interest

The pipeline will use *jellyfish* to count the kmers and then launch *kilda.py* to count the KIV2 repeats.

The output will be available in the directory set in *wdir*, notably the estimated KIV2 copy numbers are stored in *kilda_kiv2.CNs/kilda_kiv2.CNs*

This step will also produce a *counts/* folder with the kmer counts files (one per sample), a *counts.list* file, listing the sample IDs and counts file (needed as input to *kilda.py*) and *NORM_KIV2_kmers.fasta* a FASTA file with the concatenated kmers from the KIV2 and normalisation regions.

### Input formats

The samplesheet must have one sample per line, with the sample ID, a tabulation and the list of FASTQs separated by a space:

```
HG00403	/path/to/HG00403_chr6_R1.fastq /path/to/HG00403_chr6_R2.fastq
HG00318	/path/to/HG00318_chr6_R1.fastq /path/to/HG00318_chr6_R2.fastq
HG00304	/path/to/HG00304_chr6_R1.fastq /path/to/HG00304_chr6_R2.fastq
```

The rsid file must have one rsid per line, with the variant ID, a tabulation, a kmer representing the reference sequence, a tabulation and a kmer representing the alternative sequence:

```
rs41272114  AACATGATAGACATACGCATTTGGATAGTAT AACATGATAGACATATGCATTTGGATAGTAT
rs10455872  TGTTCTCAGAACCCAATGTGTTTATACAGGT TGTTCTCAGAACCCAGTGTGTTTATACAGGT
rs3798220   CAGCCTAGACACTTCTATTTCCTGAACATGA CAGCCTAGACACTTCCATTTCCTGAACATGA
```

If you are starting from BAM files, you will need to transform them into FASTQ files first, this can be done using samtools:

```shell
# First using 'view' to remove unmapped, not primary, duplicate and supplementary reads:
samtools collate -f --threads 20 -O -u --no-PG --reference reference.fasta sample_1.bam TMP/tmp.collate |\
     samtools fastq -n --threads 20 -1 sample_1_R1.fastq.gz -2 sample_1_R2.fastq.gz -s /dev/null -0 /dev/null
```

*note*: you can extract the reads corresponding to the regions of interest to speed up execution time.

### Kilda.py

This python script is run as part of *kilda.nf* but can be run independently if needed. See [dependencies](#dependencies) for the list of packages to install.

Python script to estimate the number of KIV2 repeats, based on the kmer occurences counted with [kilda.nf](#kilda)

This is run as part of [kilda.nf](#kilda-a), but can be launched independently.

#### Usage

```
kilda.py -c [counts_list.tsv] -k [KIV2_unique_31mer_with_rc.tsv] -l [LPA_unique_31mer_with_rc.tsv] -r [lpa_rsids.tsv] -o [output_folder] -p -v

Input:
     -c/--counts          File with the list of ids and counts (generated by 'jellyfish dump') files. One id and file per line, tab_delimited (required).
     -k/--kiv             File listing the curated KIV2 kmers. (required, default = './KIV2_unique_31mer_with_rc.tsv')
     -l/--lpa             File listing the curated Normalisation kmers. (required, default = './LPA_unique_31mer_with_rc.tsv')
     -r/--rsids           File listing rsids of interest and their ref and alt kmers. (optionnal, tab-delimited, no header)

Output:
     -o/--output          The path to the output folder. (default = './kilda-output/')
     -p/--plot            If set, will produce a pdf plot of the kmer occurences for each sample.

Other:
     -v/--verbose         If set, will print messages to the screen about the analysis progress.
     -h/--help            Print the usage and help and exit.
     -V/--version         Print the version and exit.
```

#### Input

The list of counts files (option -c) should contain two columns (tab delimited), *ID* and *path to the counts file*:
```
S1	/path/to/counts/S1.counts
S2	/path/to/counts/S2.counts
S3	/path/to/counts/S3.counts
S4	/path/to/counts/S4.counts
S5	/path/to/counts/S5.counts
```

Each counts file should contain 2 columns (tab delimited): *kmer* and *occurence*, and can be generated using "jellyfish dump".
```
k=31
sample_id="S1"

# Counting the kmers in the fastq files corresponding to the sample:
jellyfish count -t 6 -m ${k} -s 100M -C -o ./counts/${sample_id}_${k}mer <(zcat ./${sample_id}/fastqs/*.filt.fastq.gz);

# Querying the count file to extract the curated KIV2 and LPA kmers:
jellyfish dump ./counts/${sample_id}_${k}mer -c -t > .counts/${sample_id}.counts
```

The lists of kmers (options -k and -l) should be in txt format, one kmer per line. This can be generated with *kilda.nf* see ["kmer DB"](#kmer-db)

```
GAAACCATTTTTCCATGTCTC
CACTGATACAAATTGCCAATG
AAGTCTTTCAAGAGCTCAGGC
AACCATTTTTCCATGTCTCTG
ACGTAGATATAGAAACAGATC
AGGCTTCCTCCTACATGGTAG
GGAGGAAAAGAGCTCTACAAA
...
```

For the identification of rsids from the kmers (option -r), the input format is (ID reference\_kmer alternative\_kmer), tab-delimited, one rsid per line:

```
rs41272114      GATAGACATACGCATTTGGAT   GATAGACATATGCATTTGGAT
rs10455872      TCAGAACCCAATGTGTTTATA   TCAGAACCCAGTGTGTTTATA
rs3798220       TAGACACTTCTATTTCCTGAA   TAGACACTTCCATTTCCTGAA
```

#### Output

The script will write "kilda_kiv2.CNs" in the output folder, containing three columns: the sample ID, the CN number and the corresponding quantile within the cohort:
```
ID      KIV2_CN quantile
HG00123 14.81   2
HG00233 12.59   1
HG00141 12.36   0
HG00109 16.01   4
HG00112 17.53   6
HG00149 14.30   2
HG00106 13.03   1
HG00111 17.83   7
HG00114 17.60   7
```

If rsids are provided with the -r option, two additional columns per rsid will be created: one with the counts for the reference kmer and one with the counts for the alternative kmer:

```
ID      KIV2_CN rs41272114_ref  rs41272114_alt 	quantile
HG00114 32.53   47      		0      			4
HG00111 34.64   46      		0      			6
HG00106 40.68   44      		0      			9
HG00149 38.95   41      		0      			8
HG00112 37.01   44      		0      			7
HG00109 35.12   58      		0      			6
HG00141 29.96   52      		0      			3
HG00233 26.81   27      		22     			1
HG00123 28.53   31      		0      			2
```

If "-p" is set when launching the script, a "plots/" folder will be created and one plot per sample, showing the distribution of the occurences of the KIV2 and LPA kmers, will be saved as a pdf file.
See Figure in [Rationale](#rationale).

If the verbose option is set (-v), then a report for each sample will be written to the terminal, indicating the number of kmers with 0 occurences, the number of unknown kmers and he mean occurences:

```
	Processing 'HG00663'
        KIV2 kmers with 0 counts: 0 / 2933
        LPA kmers with 0 counts: 2680 / 74564
        Unknown kmers: 9
        KIV2 mean kmer occurence:'73.34'
        LPA  mean kmer occurence:'4.87'
        CN = 30.10

	Processing 'HG00671'
        KIV2 kmers with 0 counts: 0 / 2933
        LPA kmers with 0 counts: 2364 / 74564
        Unknown kmers: 9
        KIV2 mean kmer occurence:'88.97'
        LPA  mean kmer occurence:'5.20'
        CN = 34.19
```
